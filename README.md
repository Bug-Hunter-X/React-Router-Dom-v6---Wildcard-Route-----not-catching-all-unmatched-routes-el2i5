This repository demonstrates a problem with React Router DOM v6 where the wildcard route (*) does not correctly catch all unmatched routes.  When navigating to a route that does not exist, instead of rendering the NotFound component, the previously visited component is rendered.  The solution demonstrates how to correctly handle this issue to ensure that the wildcard route behaves as expected.
